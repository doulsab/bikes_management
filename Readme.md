Project Outline for Bikes Management System
Objective: Develop a web-based system to manage bike inventory and operations.

Technologies:

Backend:
Java Spring Boot: For creating robust backend services.
Hibernate: Object-relational mapping for database interactions.
MySQL: Database management system for storing bike data.
Frontend:
AngularJS: Frontend framework for dynamic web application development.
Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive and modern UI design.
Thymeleaf: Template engine for server-side rendering in Spring Boot.
Additional Tools:
jQuery: JavaScript library for DOM manipulation and event handling.
HTML/CSS: Basic web technologies for structuring and styling.
Project Structure:

Backend:
Define entities (Bike) using Hibernate annotations.
Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for bikes.
Configure Spring MVC controllers to handle HTTP requests.
Secure endpoints if necessary using Spring Security.
Frontend:
Create AngularJS components for displaying bike information.
Implement forms for adding and updating bike details.
Use Bootstrap for responsive design and styling.
Integrate with backend APIs using AngularJS services ($http) for data retrieval and manipulation.
Integration:
Use Thymeleaf templates for server-side rendering of initial views (if needed).
Ensure seamless communication between frontend (AngularJS) and backend (Spring Boot) using RESTful APIs.
Development Steps:

Setup: Configure development environment (Java, Spring Boot, MySQL).
Backend Development: Define entity classes, repositories, services, and controllers.
Frontend Development: Create AngularJS components, templates, and services.
Integration: Test API endpoints and frontend/backend interactions.
Styling and UI: Apply Bootstrap CSS for consistent and responsive UI.
Testing and Debugging: Ensure functionality across browsers and devices.
Deployment: Deploy the application on a server (e.g., Tomcat, AWS, Heroku).
Additional Considerations:

User Authentication: Implement login functionality (can be basic or enhanced based on requirements).
Error Handling: Properly handle and display errors to users.
Performance: Optimize backend queries and frontend rendering for improved performance.
Documentation: Document code, APIs, and deployment procedures for future reference.
